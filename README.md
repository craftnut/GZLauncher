# GZLauncher <br>

### Simple replacement launcher for GZDoom

I felt like making this because the stock launcher is kinda crap for loading mods and alternative configs
You can easily add your WADs and Mods with the file browser, or simply drag them in!
You can load multiple mods by selecting multiple in the mods mods list!

Comes with GZDoom's Default config, and my own better one ;3

### Todo:

- [ ] Easy config adder
- [ ] Custom Stylesheets
- [ ] Config generator (*maybe*, GZ's configs are *HUGE*)
